## 2026-06-30 - case-de-platform-cogpivot worked run (Yu-Chen Huang)

- **Recipe:** `case-de-platform-cogpivot` v0.1.0 · **Status:** RUNNABLE-SAMPLE
- **Inputs:** DataStax Inc, Coursera Inc, Deako Inc (from DE keyword filter on `SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped.csv`); SOC 15-1243 BLS pivot rows; `search/profile.yml`; Coursera Greenhouse URL for liveness test
- **Commands:** `grep` DE filter (70 companies) · `grep 15-1243` BLS compact · `npm run score` (5 roles) · `npm run ats:liveness` (active + expired break test)
- **Outputs:** `recipes/case-de-platform-cogpivot.md` · `assignments/submissions/yuchen-huang/domain-justification.md` · `assignments/submissions/yuchen-huang/worked-run.md`
- **Result:** Apply 2 (DataStax, Coursera), Consider 1 (Deako, Likely tier), Skip 2 (no H-1B control; expired posting liveness gate made composite 0). Skip rate 40%. Cognitive pivot verified from BLS but composite weight is still 0 in default scorer.
- **Open issues:** `[TODO: DEV]` DE title filter script; `[TODO: DEV]` platform/pipeline JD classifier; pin `role_quality` weight; DataStax Greenhouse board had 0 open jobs when I checked; scorer needs JSON profile shim (YAML profile not parsed by scorer).
- **Privacy (2026-06-30):** I removed `search/resume.json` from git tracking (file still on my laptop). Updated `.gitignore` so `npm run doctor` passes before mode PR. Resume is not in assignment zip or PR.

## 2026-06-23 — Setup Exercise: built my personal search layer (Yu-Chen Huang)

- **Recipe:** manual (Setup Exercise — Your Search's Personal Layer; agent-led extraction + intake, my attestation)
- **Inputs:** my resume PDF (kept private), my own answers, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (SOC 15-1243)
- **Outputs:** `search/resume.json` (attested), `search/profile.yml`, `search/gaps.md` (agent draft + my edits). `search/private-notes.md` is gitignored. Fixed `.gitignore` so `search/resume.json` is tracked (the repo's old `resume.json` rule was hiding it) and only `private-notes.md` is ignored.

### Three attestation errors I caught in resume.json
1. My E3 Database project was written like I did it alone, but it was a **5-person group project** (Northeastern DAMG6210). I changed it to say it was teamwork.
2. My IPL Spark project looked like original work, but I actually built it by **following a YouTube tutorial** to learn. I marked it as a learning project.
3. The E3 start date said **"Step 2024"** — a typo. The real start is **September 2024**. (I also moved R, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, CI/CD to "coursework", because they are from my classes, not my jobs.)

### Top gap (from gaps.md)
Owning a data platform's **architecture end-to-end**. So far I only built pipelines inside systems other people designed, or in a school team, or by following a tutorial. I have never designed a whole platform alone.

### Row I killed (and why)
I killed "Database administration & security (backup, access control, tuning)". That demand belongs to my **secondary** SOC (15-1242 Database Administrator), not the Data Engineer / Data Architect role (15-1243) I actually want. I am not searching for DBA jobs, so it is not my gap.

### profile.yml field I corrected from the agent's first draft
The **STEM eligibility** field. The agent's first draft marked it **"uncertain / not DSO-confirmed"** (the cautious default, because eligibility depends on the program's CIP code). I corrected it to **"eligible / dso_confirmed: true"** after confirming with my DSO.

### Verification check (the three honest answers)
- **resume.json:** Most entries are traceable — my three jobs have offer letters/pay stubs (private), and my project repos are public on GitHub. The honest weak point is the metrics (99.9% SLA, 95%, 40%, 60%): they are **rough numbers I estimated, not measured**, so I added a `metrics_disclosure` field saying exactly that instead of presenting them as audited. The agent did NOT promote any title — it kept "Intern" correctly — but it had written my team/tutorial projects as solo work until I corrected them.
- **profile.yml:** The visa dates (OPT 2026-09-14 to 2027-09-13, 0 unemployment days) are from my real documents. STEM is marked **eligible** because I confirmed it with my DSO (not just an assumption).
- **gaps.md:** Every gap is tied to a real O*NET column from the 15-1243 row (description, `skill_programming_lv` 4.12, job zone 4) or its alternate titles. The market-pattern claims (dbt/Terraform/Snowflake) are marked **VERIFY against 3 real postings** — I have not scanned postings yet, so I did not pretend that demand is confirmed.

- **Result:** `resume.json` is now **attested: true (2026-06-23)** — E3 role recorded (schema design + stored procedures), metrics disclosed as estimates, STEM confirmed. No contents from `private-notes.md` are in this log.

## 2026-06-12 — Wrote Tutorial 00 (Exercise Zero) in full

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v3, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` schema, MYCROFT.md attestation rules
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/00-personal-layer.md` — privacy-first setup (gitignore gate), paste-ready agent prompt (3 tasks with hard stops), resume.json schema with evidence fields and attested timestamp, full 8-question conditional intake tree (visa block only after a "no" at Q4), gaps draft with 3 required student edits (kill a row / rewrite a row / write one startable plan), migration rule, 4 exercises (delete test, inflation hunt, multi-model SOC second opinion, six-hour test), what-can-go-wrong table; index updated to ready
- **Result:** Exercise Zero runnable today in Claude Code with zero new scripts. Extraction-corrections count gives each student a personal fluency-vs-truth measurement on day one.
- **Open issues:** SOC matching quality from free text untested against real student answers; the agent prompt should be re-tested once the config generator lands (Tutorial 01 hand-edit note then changes); per-section attestation flags deliberately omitted in favor of one file-level timestamp — revisit if students attest carelessly.

## 2026-06-12 — Dropped personas for conditional intake; added gaps file + Exercise Zero

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: don't invent personas, ask for relevant facts — past for resume, future for wants/constraints; generate an editable gaps file; gaps migrate to resume with evidence; this is the first exercise)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v3, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (skill_*_lv / ability_*_lv columns)
- **Outputs:** design doc revised — personas replaced by conditional intake over canonical fields (question tree branches on answers, no labels); new gaps-file section (generated draft from O*NET levels + scanned-posting keyword frequency, human-owned thereafter, regenerate-as-diff, migration-to-resume.json only with evidence); Exercise Zero defined; tutorials index gains Tutorial 00 (planned)
- **Result:** Personal layer is three files with distinct epistemic status: resume.json (attested past), profile.yml (declared future), gaps.md (managed delta). Aspirational resume entries become structurally impossible. Engine extends from application allocator to development allocator (gaps = what to build in the six hours).
- **Open issues:** gap computation quality unknown until tried against a real resume + SOC pair; Tutorial 00 not yet written; intake question tree not yet drafted.

## 2026-06-12 — Added profile metadata + personas to the design

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: resume facts ≠ search metadata; US citizens shouldn't see visa questions; start with a few personas, add later)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v2
- **Outputs:** new "Profile metadata" section — four starting personas (international student, US new grad, employed-and-quietly-looking, flexible/part-time); two-layer model: canonical profile fields + personas as intake routing/defaults only; scorer weights become a function of profile fields (sponsorship weight ≈ 0 for citizens, timeline gate persona-conditional)
- **Result:** Persona proliferation avoided — combinations are field combinations, not new personas; engine reads fields, never labels. New-persona criterion is evidence-driven (recurring intake combinations the presets serve badly).
- **Open issues:** discretion mechanics for the employed persona (employer-affiliate exclusion list source?); whether persona presets live in data/ as a versioned file (recommended) or in the intake recipe prose.

## 2026-06-12 — Revised profile design: roles-first intake + resume.json layer

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: never ask for companies; ask what they want to do → SOC codes → suggest companies; resume converted to verified JSON, generated docs derive from it)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v1, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv`, `scripts/resumes/`
- **Outputs:** design doc revised — 5-step pipeline (intake → SOC resolution with human confirmation gate → generate → review/prune → scan); new resume.json section (upload → extract → field-by-field human attestation → all resume artifacts generated as projections, never rewrites); search/ layout extended; course-project mapping section (student H-1B probability tools and resume-JSON converters are the engine's missing components)
- **Result:** Companies are now an output of the engine, not an input. Resume claims become machine-checkable against attested source fields — verified-data contract extended to the student's own history.
- **Open issues:** unchanged 4 open decisions + new: JSON Resume schema as-is vs extended; where extraction-hallucination checking lives (conformance script vs gate checklist).

## 2026-06-12 — Designed profile-driven config generation

- **Recipe:** manual (triggered by human design question: why does a human hand-edit portals.yml?)
- **Inputs:** `recipes/_profile.template.md`, `scripts/ats/detect-ats.py`, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (alternate_titles columns), `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS env var)
- **Outputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` (intake → search/profile.yml → generated portals.yml with O*NET + curated synonym expansion, evidence-derived company suggestions, gitignored personal `search/` folder); Tutorial 01 Step 1 reframed (hand-editing = looking under the hood, not steady state)
- **Result:** Design connects four existing-but-disconnected pieces: profile template, detect-ats.py, O*NET alternate titles, sponsorship data. Human reads/judges generated config; never writes it.
- **Open issues:** Generator script, synonyms seed file, profile recipe, and `.gitignore` entry not yet built — design awaits approval on 4 open decisions (folder name, intake form, suggestion cap, fate of personal files in data/ats/).

## 2026-06-12 — Verified Greenhouse API liveness; fixed tutorial browser-check step

- **Recipe:** manual (triggered by human observation: `job-boards.greenhouse.io/databricks` redirects to the company careers site; same pattern at Duolingo)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/ats/providers/greenhouse.mjs` (read: provider derives `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs` and fetches with `redirect: 'error'`); fetched the Databricks and Duolingo API endpoints directly
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` Step 6 rewritten (verify against the API JSON, not the board page, with explanation of the redirect pattern); new what-can-go-wrong row
- **Result:** Both APIs live and serving: Databricks ≈97 KB payload, 100+ postings; Duolingo ≈78 KB, ≈80 postings. The browser redirect is a UI relocation, not an API removal — human-facing board pages increasingly redirect to branded careers sites while the JSON API keeps serving. Scanner unaffected by design (API-only + redirect:'error'). This partially closes the prior open issue "provider fetch not verified": the endpoint is confirmed reachable and serving from this environment's fetch tool, though still not via the scanner process itself.
- **Open issues:** Job counts are approximate (counted from match listings, not a parsed total). If Greenhouse ever moves or gates boards-api, the provider fails loudly (`fetch failed` / redirect error) — correct behavior, but worth a tutorial-02 liveness note. Some companies may genuinely leave Greenhouse; a redirected board page plus a 404 from boards-api is the signature of that case.

## 2026-06-12 — Added tutorials layer (docs/tutorials/)

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/ats/portals.example.yml`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (usage header, flags, default paths), `package.json`, MYCROFT.md conventions
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` (full predict→run→inspect→judge→record walkthrough with 6 graduated exercises and a what-can-go-wrong table), `docs/tutorials/README.md` (index; tutorials 02–05 marked planned), `DOMAIN.md` first-win section now points to the tutorial
- **Result:** The first-win command is no longer a bare one-liner; a student can complete the scan loop unassisted. Exercise 6 rehearses the attestation format; exercise 4 teaches the conformance/adequacy boundary by deliberate breakage.
- **Open issues:** Sample output numbers in Step 5 are illustrative (live fetch is blocked in this sandbox — could not capture a real success report). Tutorials 02–05 are titles only. Exercise 4's typo-provider behavior was not executed; the tutorial asks the student to discover it, but an instructor should verify the actual error message once on an unrestricted machine.

## 2026-06-12 — First honest run: BLS extract + ATS scan dry-run

- **Recipe:** manual (pre-recipe verification run under MYCROFT.md contract)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py` against `data/bls/db-30-2-text/` + `data/bls/oesm24nat/`; `npm run ats:scan -- --dry-run` with `REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS=data/ats/portals.example.yml`
- **Outputs:** `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (1,016 occupations; SHA-256 recorded in audit), `data/bls/bls-audit.md` (962/1,016 = 94.7% matched to OEWS 2024 detailed SOC rows)
- **Result:** BLS extractor runs clean after the `Skills.txt` fix; audit generated and read; CSV schema unchanged (`skill_*` columns intact). ATS scan loaded the example portal config, matched the Greenhouse provider, ran filter/dedup/report logic, and wrote nothing in dry-run mode — machinery verified.
- **Open issues:** ATS scan's live fetch failed in the sandboxed environment (network egress blocked) — provider fetch is **not** verified end-to-end; rerun on an unrestricted machine. BLS extractor was not executed pre-fix, so "failed before fix" is inferred from the missing `Recipes.txt` file, not observed. `playwright`/`sharp` not installed; only `js-yaml`/`glob` were needed for this run.

## 2026-06-12 — Fixed rename-shrapnel bugs; added lifecycle frontmatter

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py`, `scripts/ats/analyze-patterns.py`, `scripts/ats/README.md`, 8 core recipe files
- **Outputs:** three one-line fixes (`Recipes.txt`→`Skills.txt`; `modes/RUN_LOG.md`→`logs/RUN_LOG.md` in script and README; audit prose "recipe Level scores"→"skill Level scores"); MYCROFT.md lifecycle frontmatter added to `_shared` (type: contract) and `scan`, `pipeline`, `oferta`, `tracker`, `pdf`, `patterns`, `update` (status: DRAFT, todos_open: 11 each)
- **Result:** Known defects 1–2 from DOMAIN.md closed. Recipe status is now machine-readable.
- **Open issues:** `scripts/cowork-agentic-repo.py` still contains mangled prose ("Recipes and recipes…") — cosmetic, not load-bearing. The 33 non-core recipes have no frontmatter yet.

## 2026-06-11 — Established MYCROFT.md as source of truth

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** architecture review of the full repo; Codex cross-review; Gru SDD; principles discussion (Cowork session)
- **Outputs:** `MYCROFT.md` (new — constitution v0.1.0: 8 principles, verification stack, recipe lifecycle, TODO-closure evidence, attestation format), `DOMAIN.md` (new — domain manifest: actual layout, runnable command surface, known gaps/defects), `CLAUDE.md` (rewritten as pointer to MYCROFT.md), `AGENTS.md` (rewritten as pointer; also removed "recipes, recipes" rename shrapnel)
- **Result:** One governing file; precedence rule explicit; current-vs-planned architecture separated (domain layout is current; `data/raw`/`data/verified`/snickerdoodle CLI marked roadmap). Claude Code named as v0 runtime.
- **Open issues:** Known defects listed in DOMAIN.md §Known gaps: BLS `Recipes.txt` bug, `modes/RUN_LOG.md` path bug, scorer unimplemented, no recipe has a logged run, doctor script not built, person-named recipes need privacy review, skill/recipe terminology in manuscript unreconciled. README and `docs/` not yet updated to cite MYCROFT.md.

## 2026-05-28 — Recipe folder converted to verified-data workflows

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `recipes/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`
- **Outputs:** `recipes/_shared.md`, `recipes/README.md`, active recipes, and draft/helper recipe files
- **Result:** Recipes now point students toward repo scripts, audits, and logs instead of prompt-only recipes.
- **Open issues:** Some workflows remain intentionally marked as draft until supporting scripts exist.

## 2026-05-28 — Removed copied Job-Ops source tree

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/career-ops-main/`, `scripts/ats/`, `recipes/`, `resumes/`
- **Outputs:** `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`, provider docs
- **Result:** Removed the copied reference directory after useful pieces had been adapted into maintained repo paths.
- **Open issues:** Provenance now lives in docs and adapted files, not in a local source copy.

## 2026-05-28 — Normalized data directory names

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** old mixed-case 80 Days and BLS data directories, `data/sec/form-d/`
- **Outputs:** `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `data/bls/`, lower-kebab SEC extracted folders, updated docs/scripts
- **Result:** Source/reference data directories now use lower-case kebab-case names. Maintained automation now uses lowercase `scripts/` by repo convention.
- **Open issues:** Some source data filenames and JSON field values still preserve upstream naming.

## 2026-06-13 -- Context parity + privacy pass + doctor (consolidated; re-logged after a git reset dropped prior entries)

- **Parity:** brought this repo to the Madison/Mycroft context architecture — ported `conformance.mjs`/`to-markdown.mjs`/`build-instructions.mjs`, added `instructions/` (6 shared rule modules + `reallocation-engine.md` + manifest) compiling to generated root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, plus `.claude/` hooks (archive-guard + conformance-check) and `.github/workflows/verify.yml` (conformance + instruction drift guard). `MYCROFT.md` confirmed identical to the other Mycroft-domain repos.
- **Privacy pass (gap #6):** 14 person-named case-study recipes anonymized -> `case-*.md` role slugs; student names + Canvas submission-IDs scrubbed. Verified zero residual PII repo-wide. Git **history** also purged via `git filter-repo` (--invert-paths on the 14 old paths + --replace-text on names/IDs); force-pushed.
- **doctor (gap #5):** `scripts/doctor.mjs` (`npm run doctor`) — environment + npm-command-target + domain-dir checks + recipe-status dashboard. Surfaced gap #8: only 7/42 recipes carry lifecycle frontmatter; declared todos_open (77) vs 518 body `[TODO` markers.
- **Note:** a later `git reset`/`filter-repo` reverted edits to pre-existing tracked files (DOMAIN.md gaps reconciliation, this log, package.json scripts, generated AGENTS/CLAUDE) while new files survived; re-applied 2026-06-13. New files were unaffected.
- **Result:** doctor + conformance green; DOMAIN.md known-gaps reconciled (#1,#2,#5,#6 resolved; #3,#4,#7,#8 open).

## 2026-06-13 -- Backfill recipe lifecycle frontmatter (gap #8)

- **Commands:** One-off migration over recipes/ (excl. README + templates): prepended a `status/todos_open/last_gate/attestation/recipe_version` block to the 34 recipes that lacked one, injected the lifecycle keys into `_shared.md` (kept `type: contract`), and reconciled `todos_open` to the true `[TODO`-marker body count everywhere. 7 already-stamped recipes unchanged (idempotent).
- **Result:** doctor now reports 42/42 recipes with frontmatter, 0 missing; declared todos_open == body markers (518 = 518, mismatch gone). Conformance clean. DOMAIN gap #8 resolved.
- **Open issues:** All 42 remain `status: DRAFT` — promotion past DRAFT still requires a real gated run (gap #4) + attestation. Frontmatter is now the substrate for that lifecycle tracking.

## 2026-06-13 -- Build the Bayesian Role Scorer (gap #3)

- **Skill:** Implement the book's Chapter-11 decision core — the composite role scorer / combiner.
- **Inputs:** spec from `chapters/11-the-bayesian-role-scorer.md` (composite form, weights sponsorship 0.35 / fit 0.30, multiplicative liveness+timeline gates, threshold ~0.3, Apply/Consider/Skip, override discipline, auditability thesis) + `docs/search-profile-design.md` (weights are a function of the profile, not constants). Confirmed exact structure by reproducing the chapter's worked example backward.
- **Commands:** Wrote `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs` — combiner only (reads per-role evidence records; does not compute components). Multiplicative gates × weighted votes; profile-conditional sponsorship weight (→0 when authorization doesn't need sponsorship); per-term audit trace with source labels (record / model-judgment / your-input); documented-override support (override without a reason is ignored, per Ch.11); JSON + Markdown report + skip-rate summary. Config block annotates every weight/threshold with provenance; role_quality weight + Consider floor left as documented `[VERIFY]` defaults (not pinned by the chapter). Built fixture `data/examples/ch11-roles.json` reproducing the chapter's two roles + gate/Consider/override cases. Wired `npm run score`.
- **Result:** Verified against the book — Cambridge biotech composite 0.446 → Apply; identical-fit non-sponsor 0.178 → Skip; ghost posting gated to 0 → Skip; Likely-tier → Consider; documented override flips Skip→Apply and records the reason. Conformance clean; doctor sees the new command. DOMAIN gap #3 resolved.
- **Open issues:** `[VERIFY]` weights (role_quality, Consider floor) need confirmation vs the system design document before real decisions. The scorer is a pure combiner — wiring the upstream feeds (Ch.7/8/9/10) to emit the per-role evidence envelope is separate (the run-envelope schema is still `[TODO: DEFINE]` in recipes/pipeline.md) and tied to the honest run (gap #4).

## 2026-06-14 -- The honest run (gap #4): first gated, logged recipe run

- **Recipe:** `oferta` (Ch.11 Bayesian role scorer), **sample mode**, run id `oferta-2026-06-14-001`.
- **Command:** `npm run score data/examples/ch11-roles.json` (stored script; no ad-hoc code).
- **Inputs:** verified fixture `data/examples/ch11-roles.json` + run-envelope (`mode: sample`).
- **Gates:** 1 Source ✓ · 2 Scope ✓ (sample) · 3 Data-shape ✓ · 4 Script-readiness ✓ · 5 Approval n/a (no live network/writes/model) · 6 Report ✓. Human adequacy gate: **PENDING attestation.**
- **Result:** 5 roles → Apply 2 · Consider 1 · Skip 2 (skip 40%). Cambridge 0.446 / non-sponsor 0.178 reproduce Ch.11. Output fully sourced (record / model-judgment / your-input).
- **Artifacts:** `logs/oferta-2026-06-14.json`, `reports/generated/oferta-2026-06-14.md`, `data/examples/role-scores.{json,md}`.
- **Flags:** skip-rate 40% < 50% (curated fixture, expected); `role_quality` weight 0 [VERIFY] drops the Ch.9 signal (gap #3); 1 documented override.
- **Open:** machine half of P4 done; **human adequacy (P4 second half) outstanding** — attest to promote `oferta` past DRAFT.

## 2026-06-14 -- Rename MYCROFT.md → SNICKERDOODLE.md (constitution rebrand)

- **Why:** disambiguate this repo's constitution from the shared **Mycroft** agent-OS frame it was forked from. Renamed to a cookie-recipe name fitting the book's "recipe" vocabulary.
- **Did:** `git mv MYCROFT.md SNICKERDOODLE.md`; rebranded the file's own identity (`# SNICKERDOODLE`, "Snickerdoodle is an agent-operating system…", lineage line preserved). Swapped every `MYCROFT.md` path/governance reference (instructions/ source, `conformance.mjs` required-files list, `manifest.yml` `@import`, CI comment, `DOMAIN.md`, `status.md`, `archive/README.md`, docs/). Rebranded this-repo "Mycroft" prose (P4, "a Snickerdoodle domain", audit doc); **kept** the cross-repo "Madison and Mycroft" shared-library mention.
- **Rebuilt:** `node scripts/build-instructions.mjs --promote` → `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` regenerated; `CLAUDE.md` now imports `@SNICKERDOODLE.md`.
- **Untouched:** `data/` CSVs (real company names containing "mycroft") and prior RUN_LOG history (append-only).
- **Result:** conformance + doctor green; no stale `MYCROFT.md` outside data/history.
