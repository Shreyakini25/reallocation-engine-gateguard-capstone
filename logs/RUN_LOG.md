## 2026-06-26 — Setup Exercise (INFO 7375): personal layer built and attested

- **Recipe:** manual — Setup Exercise — Your Search's Personal Layer (Course: INFO 7375)
- **Inputs:** `Mercury-CV-GoogleSAP.pdf` (read locally, never copied verbatim into a tracked file); profile-intake answers given live; assignment text (Steps 0–5 + verification check).
- **Outputs:**
  - `search/resume.json` — attested past: 2 education rows, 2 work rows, 1 in-progress project, skills block, `attested: true` with date and a three-error attestation note.
  - `search/profile.yml` — target role, F-1/CPT-now → OPT-expected timeline (anticipated dates, not EAD-issued), Bay Area geography, sector preferences with hard exclusions, sponsorship `required: true` + `gate_behavior: skip-regardless`.
  - `search/gaps.md` — 4 active gap rows (Kubernetes ops, cloud-provider production work, IaC/Terraform, on-call) + 1 killed row (Go) + row-1 rewritten in personal voice.
  - `.gitignore` — added `!search/resume.json` to override the repo-wide `resume.json` rule; added `search/private-notes.md` to keep honest self-assessments out of git.
- **Result — built (Step 5 required bullets):**
  - **What was built:** the three files above (`resume.json`, `profile.yml`, `gaps.md`) plus the `.gitignore` change; `search/private-notes.md` deliberately not committed.
  - **Three attestation errors caught in `resume.json`:**
    1. PaddleOCR — agent imported the resume's "Achievements (Expected)" bullets as actual achievements; reclassified under `expected_outcomes` with `status: not yet measured`. The ≥2x speedup is a target driving the work, not a result.
    2. SAP — agent imported "Unified cross-platform workflows across Windows and Linux" as written; only Linux work appears in the responsibilities. Scope narrowed to Linux; the Windows claim had no supporting bullet.
    3. Duplicate ~30% claim — both SAP and Eth Tech entries arrived with the same round figure for deployment-time improvement. Round-number collision is a fluency artifact, not a measurement. Both flagged `measurement_verified: false` until the source benchmark is recovered.
  - **Top gap from `gaps.md`:** Production Kubernetes / container-orchestration ops at the cluster-ops level (not just Dockerfile authorship). Three target-sector postings (Google SRE, SAP BTP SRE, AWS Platform) all list it as a required, not preferred, skill.
  - **Killed row and why:** "Production Go programming" — the agent's draft listed Go as a hard gap because "Google" appeared in the target metro and the model pattern-matched "Google SRE" → Go. Actual Google SRE postings accept "Python, Java, C++, Go, or equivalent"; SAP BTP is JVM/ABAP-heavy; AWS is mostly Python/Java. With Python + ABAP + TypeScript already attested, Go is one path, not a gate. The row was fluency dressing as evidence — exactly the failure mode the course exists to catch.
  - **Field in `profile.yml` corrected from agent's first draft:** `visa_and_timeline.stem_eligible` — agent's first pass set it to `yes` because MIS at NEU is "commonly STEM." Corrected to `value: uncertain` with `action_owed: email DSO to confirm CIP code before treating STEM as available`. Following the assignment's explicit warning: a wrong STEM gate produces Apply recommendations for roles that cannot legally be taken.
- **Result — verification check (Step 4 answers):**
  - **`resume.json`** — every job entry has a `verifiable_by` field naming a non-self source (offer letter, transcript, manager reference, public GitHub history). No title was promoted past the resume's wording; no date was shifted from the resume. The CUDA skill from NEU coursework is filed under `coursework_only_not_yet_production` precisely so it does not pose as a shipped skill.
  - **`profile.yml`** — the visa block describes the issued-status (F-1 + CPT used at SAP) plus anticipated OPT dates derived from graduation timing, marked anticipated and not from an EAD. STEM eligibility is `uncertain` per assignment guidance (DSO confirmation owed). No date asserts an authorization that has not been issued.
  - **`gaps.md`** — every active row cites an O*NET skill level (SOC 15-1244.00, 15-1252.00) or a three-posting pattern in the target sector, plus a closing condition someone other than me can verify (merged PR, cert ID, published postmortem). Row 1 carries a `TODO collect 3 specific job-board URLs` flag so that the posting-pattern claim is anchored to specific links before the engine scores against it. No row sources its demand signal to model intuition.
- **Open issues:**
  - Row 1 of `gaps.md` still needs 3 specific posting URLs attached before the engine runs against it; the pattern claim is currently grounded in the role-category description, not in URL-anchored postings.
  - OPT dates in `profile.yml` are anticipated, not issued. Re-attest the `visa_and_timeline.opt` block when the EAD is in hand.
  - STEM-eligibility marked uncertain pending DSO confirmation. Re-attest after the DSO emails back.
  - `package-lock.json` and other repo tooling not exercised by this exercise; conformance not re-run.
  - `search/private-notes.md` was not created in this commit (no honest self-assessment captured here); intentionally left for the human to add separately so its contents never enter agent context.



- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v3, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` schema, MYCROFT.md attestation rules
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/00-personal-layer.md` — privacy-first setup (gitignore gate), paste-ready agent prompt (3 tasks with hard stops), resume.json schema with evidence fields and attested timestamp, full 8-question conditional intake tree (visa block only after a "no" at Q4), gaps draft with 3 required student edits (kill a row / rewrite a row / write one startable plan), migration rule, 4 exercises (delete test, inflation hunt, multi-model SOC second opinion, six-hour test), what-can-go-wrong table; index updated to ready
- **Result:** Exercise Zero runnable today in Claude Code with zero new scripts. Extraction-corrections count gives each student a personal fluency-vs-truth measurement on day one.
- **Open issues:** SOC matching quality from free text untested against real student answers; the agent prompt should be re-tested once the config generator lands (Tutorial 01 hand-edit note then changes); per-section attestation flags deliberately omitted in favor of one file-level timestamp — revisit if students attest carelessly.

## 2026-06-12 — Dropped personas for conditional intake; added gaps file + Exercise Zero

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: don't invent personas, ask for relevant facts — past for resume, future for wants/constraints; generate an editable gaps file; gaps migrate to resume with evidence; this is the first exercise)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v3, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (skill_*_lv / ability_*_lv columns)
- **Outputs:** design doc revised — personas replaced by conditional intake over canonical fields (question tree branches on answers, no labels); new gaps-file section (generated draft from O*NET levels + scanned-posting keyword frequency, human-owned thereafter, regenerate-as-diff, migration-to-resume.json only with evidence); Exercise Zero defined; tutorials index gains Tutorial 00 (planned)
- **Result:** Personal layer is three files with distinct epistemic status: resume.json (attested past), profile.yml (declared future), gaps.md (managed delta). Aspirational resume entries become structurally impossible. Engine extends from application allocator to development allocator (gaps = what to build in the six hours).
- **Open issues:** gap computation quality unknown until tried against a real resume + SOC pair; Tutorial 00 not yet written; intake question tree not yet drafted.

## 2026-06-12 — Added profile metadata + personas to the design

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: resume facts ≠ search metadata; US citizens shouldn't see visa questions; start with a few personas, add later)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v2
- **Outputs:** new "Profile metadata" section — four starting personas (international student, US new grad, employed-and-quietly-looking, flexible/part-time); two-layer model: canonical profile fields + personas as intake routing/defaults only; scorer weights become a function of profile fields (sponsorship weight ≈ 0 for citizens, timeline gate persona-conditional)
- **Result:** Persona proliferation avoided — combinations are field combinations, not new personas; engine reads fields, never labels. New-persona criterion is evidence-driven (recurring intake combinations the presets serve badly).
- **Open issues:** discretion mechanics for the employed persona (employer-affiliate exclusion list source?); whether persona presets live in data/ as a versioned file (recommended) or in the intake recipe prose.

## 2026-06-12 — Revised profile design: roles-first intake + resume.json layer

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: never ask for companies; ask what they want to do → SOC codes → suggest companies; resume converted to verified JSON, generated docs derive from it)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v1, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv`, `scripts/resumes/`
- **Outputs:** design doc revised — 5-step pipeline (intake → SOC resolution with human confirmation gate → generate → review/prune → scan); new resume.json section (upload → extract → field-by-field human attestation → all resume artifacts generated as projections, never rewrites); search/ layout extended; course-project mapping section (student H-1B probability tools and resume-JSON converters are the engine's missing components)
- **Result:** Companies are now an output of the engine, not an input. Resume claims become machine-checkable against attested source fields — verified-data contract extended to the student's own history.
- **Open issues:** unchanged 4 open decisions + new: JSON Resume schema as-is vs extended; where extraction-hallucination checking lives (conformance script vs gate checklist).

## 2026-06-12 — Designed profile-driven config generation

- **Recipe:** manual (triggered by human design question: why does a human hand-edit portals.yml?)
- **Inputs:** `recipes/_profile.template.md`, `scripts/ats/detect-ats.py`, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (alternate_titles columns), `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS env var)
- **Outputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` (intake → search/profile.yml → generated portals.yml with O*NET + curated synonym expansion, evidence-derived company suggestions, gitignored personal `search/` folder); Tutorial 01 Step 1 reframed (hand-editing = looking under the hood, not steady state)
- **Result:** Design connects four existing-but-disconnected pieces: profile template, detect-ats.py, O*NET alternate titles, sponsorship data. Human reads/judges generated config; never writes it.
- **Open issues:** Generator script, synonyms seed file, profile recipe, and `.gitignore` entry not yet built — design awaits approval on 4 open decisions (folder name, intake form, suggestion cap, fate of personal files in data/ats/).

## 2026-06-12 — Verified Greenhouse API liveness; fixed tutorial browser-check step

- **Recipe:** manual (triggered by human observation: `job-boards.greenhouse.io/databricks` redirects to the company careers site; same pattern at Duolingo)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/ats/providers/greenhouse.mjs` (read: provider derives `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs` and fetches with `redirect: 'error'`); fetched the Databricks and Duolingo API endpoints directly
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` Step 6 rewritten (verify against the API JSON, not the board page, with explanation of the redirect pattern); new what-can-go-wrong row
- **Result:** Both APIs live and serving: Databricks ≈97 KB payload, 100+ postings; Duolingo ≈78 KB, ≈80 postings. The browser redirect is a UI relocation, not an API removal — human-facing board pages increasingly redirect to branded careers sites while the JSON API keeps serving. Scanner unaffected by design (API-only + redirect:'error'). This partially closes the prior open issue "provider fetch not verified": the endpoint is confirmed reachable and serving from this environment's fetch tool, though still not via the scanner process itself.
- **Open issues:** Job counts are approximate (counted from match listings, not a parsed total). If Greenhouse ever moves or gates boards-api, the provider fails loudly (`fetch failed` / redirect error) — correct behavior, but worth a tutorial-02 liveness note. Some companies may genuinely leave Greenhouse; a redirected board page plus a 404 from boards-api is the signature of that case.

## 2026-06-12 — Added tutorials layer (docs/tutorials/)

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/ats/portals.example.yml`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (usage header, flags, default paths), `package.json`, MYCROFT.md conventions
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` (full predict→run→inspect→judge→record walkthrough with 6 graduated exercises and a what-can-go-wrong table), `docs/tutorials/README.md` (index; tutorials 02–05 marked planned), `DOMAIN.md` first-win section now points to the tutorial
- **Result:** The first-win command is no longer a bare one-liner; a student can complete the scan loop unassisted. Exercise 6 rehearses the attestation format; exercise 4 teaches the conformance/adequacy boundary by deliberate breakage.
- **Open issues:** Sample output numbers in Step 5 are illustrative (live fetch is blocked in this sandbox — could not capture a real success report). Tutorials 02–05 are titles only. Exercise 4's typo-provider behavior was not executed; the tutorial asks the student to discover it, but an instructor should verify the actual error message once on an unrestricted machine.

## 2026-06-12 — First honest run: BLS extract + ATS scan dry-run

- **Recipe:** manual (pre-recipe verification run under MYCROFT.md contract)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py` against `data/bls/db-30-2-text/` + `data/bls/oesm24nat/`; `npm run ats:scan -- --dry-run` with `REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS=data/ats/portals.example.yml`
- **Outputs:** `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (1,016 occupations; SHA-256 recorded in audit), `data/bls/bls-audit.md` (962/1,016 = 94.7% matched to OEWS 2024 detailed SOC rows)
- **Result:** BLS extractor runs clean after the `Skills.txt` fix; audit generated and read; CSV schema unchanged (`skill_*` columns intact). ATS scan loaded the example portal config, matched the Greenhouse provider, ran filter/dedup/report logic, and wrote nothing in dry-run mode — machinery verified.
- **Open issues:** ATS scan's live fetch failed in the sandboxed environment (network egress blocked) — provider fetch is **not** verified end-to-end; rerun on an unrestricted machine. BLS extractor was not executed pre-fix, so "failed before fix" is inferred from the missing `Recipes.txt` file, not observed. `playwright`/`sharp` not installed; only `js-yaml`/`glob` were needed for this run.

## 2026-06-12 — Fixed rename-shrapnel bugs; added lifecycle frontmatter

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py`, `scripts/ats/analyze-patterns.py`, `scripts/ats/README.md`, 8 core recipe files
- **Outputs:** three one-line fixes (`Recipes.txt`→`Skills.txt`; `modes/RUN_LOG.md`→`logs/RUN_LOG.md` in script and README; audit prose "recipe Level scores"→"skill Level scores"); MYCROFT.md lifecycle frontmatter added to `_shared` (type: contract) and `scan`, `pipeline`, `oferta`, `tracker`, `pdf`, `patterns`, `update` (status: DRAFT, todos_open: 11 each)
- **Result:** Known defects 1–2 from DOMAIN.md closed. Recipe status is now machine-readable.
- **Open issues:** `scripts/cowork-agentic-repo.py` still contains mangled prose ("Recipes and recipes…") — cosmetic, not load-bearing. The 33 non-core recipes have no frontmatter yet.

## 2026-06-11 — Established MYCROFT.md as source of truth

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** architecture review of the full repo; Codex cross-review; Gru SDD; principles discussion (Cowork session)
- **Outputs:** `MYCROFT.md` (new — constitution v0.1.0: 8 principles, verification stack, recipe lifecycle, TODO-closure evidence, attestation format), `DOMAIN.md` (new — domain manifest: actual layout, runnable command surface, known gaps/defects), `CLAUDE.md` (rewritten as pointer to MYCROFT.md), `AGENTS.md` (rewritten as pointer; also removed "recipes, recipes" rename shrapnel)
- **Result:** One governing file; precedence rule explicit; current-vs-planned architecture separated (domain layout is current; `data/raw`/`data/verified`/snickerdoodle CLI marked roadmap). Claude Code named as v0 runtime.
- **Open issues:** Known defects listed in DOMAIN.md §Known gaps: BLS `Recipes.txt` bug, `modes/RUN_LOG.md` path bug, scorer unimplemented, no recipe has a logged run, doctor script not built, person-named recipes need privacy review, skill/recipe terminology in manuscript unreconciled. README and `docs/` not yet updated to cite MYCROFT.md.

## 2026-05-28 — Recipe folder converted to verified-data workflows

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `recipes/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`
- **Outputs:** `recipes/_shared.md`, `recipes/README.md`, active recipes, and draft/helper recipe files
- **Result:** Recipes now point students toward repo scripts, audits, and logs instead of prompt-only recipes.
- **Open issues:** Some workflows remain intentionally marked as draft until supporting scripts exist.

## 2026-05-28 — Removed copied Job-Ops source tree

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/career-ops-main/`, `scripts/ats/`, `recipes/`, `resumes/`
- **Outputs:** `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`, provider docs
- **Result:** Removed the copied reference directory after useful pieces had been adapted into maintained repo paths.
- **Open issues:** Provenance now lives in docs and adapted files, not in a local source copy.

## 2026-05-28 — Normalized data directory names

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** old mixed-case 80 Days and BLS data directories, `data/sec/form-d/`
- **Outputs:** `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `data/bls/`, lower-kebab SEC extracted folders, updated docs/scripts
- **Result:** Source/reference data directories now use lower-case kebab-case names. Maintained automation now uses lowercase `scripts/` by repo convention.
- **Open issues:** Some source data filenames and JSON field values still preserve upstream naming.

## 2026-06-13 -- Context parity + privacy pass + doctor (consolidated; re-logged after a git reset dropped prior entries)

- **Parity:** brought this repo to the Madison/Mycroft context architecture — ported `conformance.mjs`/`to-markdown.mjs`/`build-instructions.mjs`, added `instructions/` (6 shared rule modules + `reallocation-engine.md` + manifest) compiling to generated root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, plus `.claude/` hooks (archive-guard + conformance-check) and `.github/workflows/verify.yml` (conformance + instruction drift guard). `MYCROFT.md` confirmed identical to the other Mycroft-domain repos.
- **Privacy pass (gap #6):** 14 person-named case-study recipes anonymized -> `case-*.md` role slugs; student names + Canvas submission-IDs scrubbed. Verified zero residual PII repo-wide. Git **history** also purged via `git filter-repo` (--invert-paths on the 14 old paths + --replace-text on names/IDs); force-pushed.
- **doctor (gap #5):** `scripts/doctor.mjs` (`npm run doctor`) — environment + npm-command-target + domain-dir checks + recipe-status dashboard. Surfaced gap #8: only 7/42 recipes carry lifecycle frontmatter; declared todos_open (77) vs 518 body `[TODO` markers.
- **Note:** a later `git reset`/`filter-repo` reverted edits to pre-existing tracked files (DOMAIN.md gaps reconciliation, this log, package.json scripts, generated AGENTS/CLAUDE) while new files survived; re-applied 2026-06-13. New files were unaffected.
- **Result:** doctor + conformance green; DOMAIN.md known-gaps reconciled (#1,#2,#5,#6 resolved; #3,#4,#7,#8 open).

## 2026-06-13 -- Backfill recipe lifecycle frontmatter (gap #8)

- **Commands:** One-off migration over recipes/ (excl. README + templates): prepended a `status/todos_open/last_gate/attestation/recipe_version` block to the 34 recipes that lacked one, injected the lifecycle keys into `_shared.md` (kept `type: contract`), and reconciled `todos_open` to the true `[TODO`-marker body count everywhere. 7 already-stamped recipes unchanged (idempotent).
- **Result:** doctor now reports 42/42 recipes with frontmatter, 0 missing; declared todos_open == body markers (518 = 518, mismatch gone). Conformance clean. DOMAIN gap #8 resolved.
- **Open issues:** All 42 remain `status: DRAFT` — promotion past DRAFT still requires a real gated run (gap #4) + attestation. Frontmatter is now the substrate for that lifecycle tracking.

## 2026-06-13 -- Build the Bayesian Role Scorer (gap #3)

- **Skill:** Implement the book's Chapter-11 decision core — the composite role scorer / combiner.
- **Inputs:** spec from `chapters/11-the-bayesian-role-scorer.md` (composite form, weights sponsorship 0.35 / fit 0.30, multiplicative liveness+timeline gates, threshold ~0.3, Apply/Consider/Skip, override discipline, auditability thesis) + `docs/search-profile-design.md` (weights are a function of the profile, not constants). Confirmed exact structure by reproducing the chapter's worked example backward.
- **Commands:** Wrote `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs` — combiner only (reads per-role evidence records; does not compute components). Multiplicative gates × weighted votes; profile-conditional sponsorship weight (→0 when authorization doesn't need sponsorship); per-term audit trace with source labels (record / model-judgment / your-input); documented-override support (override without a reason is ignored, per Ch.11); JSON + Markdown report + skip-rate summary. Config block annotates every weight/threshold with provenance; role_quality weight + Consider floor left as documented `[VERIFY]` defaults (not pinned by the chapter). Built fixture `data/examples/ch11-roles.json` reproducing the chapter's two roles + gate/Consider/override cases. Wired `npm run score`.
- **Result:** Verified against the book — Cambridge biotech composite 0.446 → Apply; identical-fit non-sponsor 0.178 → Skip; ghost posting gated to 0 → Skip; Likely-tier → Consider; documented override flips Skip→Apply and records the reason. Conformance clean; doctor sees the new command. DOMAIN gap #3 resolved.
- **Open issues:** `[VERIFY]` weights (role_quality, Consider floor) need confirmation vs the system design document before real decisions. The scorer is a pure combiner — wiring the upstream feeds (Ch.7/8/9/10) to emit the per-role evidence envelope is separate (the run-envelope schema is still `[TODO: DEFINE]` in recipes/pipeline.md) and tied to the honest run (gap #4).

## 2026-06-14 -- The honest run (gap #4): first gated, logged recipe run

- **Recipe:** `oferta` (Ch.11 Bayesian role scorer), **sample mode**, run id `oferta-2026-06-14-001`.
- **Command:** `npm run score data/examples/ch11-roles.json` (stored script; no ad-hoc code).
- **Inputs:** verified fixture `data/examples/ch11-roles.json` + run-envelope (`mode: sample`).
- **Gates:** 1 Source ✓ · 2 Scope ✓ (sample) · 3 Data-shape ✓ · 4 Script-readiness ✓ · 5 Approval n/a (no live network/writes/model) · 6 Report ✓. Human adequacy gate: **PENDING attestation.**
- **Result:** 5 roles → Apply 2 · Consider 1 · Skip 2 (skip 40%). Cambridge 0.446 / non-sponsor 0.178 reproduce Ch.11. Output fully sourced (record / model-judgment / your-input).
- **Artifacts:** `logs/oferta-2026-06-14.json`, `reports/generated/oferta-2026-06-14.md`, `data/examples/role-scores.{json,md}`.
- **Flags:** skip-rate 40% < 50% (curated fixture, expected); `role_quality` weight 0 [VERIFY] drops the Ch.9 signal (gap #3); 1 documented override.
- **Open:** machine half of P4 done; **human adequacy (P4 second half) outstanding** — attest to promote `oferta` past DRAFT.

## 2026-06-14 -- Rename MYCROFT.md → SNICKERDOODLE.md (constitution rebrand)

- **Why:** disambiguate this repo's constitution from the shared **Mycroft** agent-OS frame it was forked from. Renamed to a cookie-recipe name fitting the book's "recipe" vocabulary.
- **Did:** `git mv MYCROFT.md SNICKERDOODLE.md`; rebranded the file's own identity (`# SNICKERDOODLE`, "Snickerdoodle is an agent-operating system…", lineage line preserved). Swapped every `MYCROFT.md` path/governance reference (instructions/ source, `conformance.mjs` required-files list, `manifest.yml` `@import`, CI comment, `DOMAIN.md`, `status.md`, `archive/README.md`, docs/). Rebranded this-repo "Mycroft" prose (P4, "a Snickerdoodle domain", audit doc); **kept** the cross-repo "Madison and Mycroft" shared-library mention.
- **Rebuilt:** `node scripts/build-instructions.mjs --promote` → `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` regenerated; `CLAUDE.md` now imports `@SNICKERDOODLE.md`.
- **Untouched:** `data/` CSVs (real company names containing "mycroft") and prior RUN_LOG history (append-only).
- **Result:** conformance + doctor green; no stale `MYCROFT.md` outside data/history.

## 2026-06-29 -- case-ic-layout-fit (RUNNABLE-SAMPLE) — IC layout SOC/sponsorship fit

- **Mode:** `recipes/case-ic-layout-fit.md` v0.2.0 · by Zhenhao Ma.
- **Inputs:** real Micron memory-layout posting; SOC set {17-2061/72/71, 17-3012}; `data/examples/case-ic-layout-roles.json`.
- **Commands:** `npm run verify`; `grep` SOC compact; `node scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs data/examples/case-ic-layout-roles.json`; scan `data/sec/form-d/processed/`.
- **Result:** engineer-SOC and drafter-SOC score identically (0.217 = 0.217) — `role_quality` weight 0 hides the SOC trap; Micron drops the sponsorship vote → Consider not Apply (vs 0.484 control). Break: liveness 0 → 0.000 Skip; role_quality 1.0 vs 0.0 → both 0.150.
- **Gates:** 1 Source ✓ · 2 Scope ✓ · 3 Data-shape ✓ · 4 Script-readiness OPEN (2 scripts [TODO: DEV]) · 5 Approval n/a · 6 Report ✓.
- **Open:** `scripts/bls/classify-layout-role.py` [TODO: DEV]; `role_quality` weight [TODO: VERIFY]; `scripts/lca/semiconductor-layout-sponsorship.py` [TODO: DEV].
- **Privacy:** no secrets, no private application data.
