## About this book

*The Reallocation Engine* is a book and a working machine at once. The chapters teach a method for running a high-stakes search — specifically, the job search of an international student on an F-1 visa with the OPT clock running — and the same repository contains the scripts, data, and operating recipes that *run* that method. You can clone it, open a terminal, type a command, and get a sourced Apply / Consider / Skip decision about a real role. The book is not a description of a system that lives somewhere else; the book *is* the system, explained.

Its argument starts with the fluency trap: the first sign of trouble is usually not failure but fluency. A draft looks clean, an answer sounds reasonable, the code runs — and nothing on the surface announces that a human still has work to do. AI has made that surface cheap to produce, and in making *execution* cheap it has left *judgment* scarce. For a student with sixty to ninety days to find a sponsoring employer, that gap is an emergency: scarce effort, spent confidently, in the wrong place. The engine exists to **reallocate** that effort — away from polished cold applications the evidence says will go nowhere, and toward the few roles where a record, not a feeling, says effort can matter.

It does this by refusing to fight fluency with more fluency. Every count, rate, and confidence traces to a source (the verified-data contract); some facts — a dead posting, an impossible visa timeline — veto a role outright rather than nudging a score (gates, not votes); and a healthy run skips at least half of what it evaluates, because the engine's value is in the applications it talks you out of. The machine executes up to a deliberate phase gate and then hands the decision back to you with every source labeled, so the part that is irreducibly human — deciding whether a role is worth a day of your life — stays yours.

The book is for international students on the clock, for the advisors and Humanitarians AI fellows who work alongside them, and for anyone who wants to see what disciplined human–AI collaboration looks like when a real deadline removes the option of self-deception. It is not immigration counsel, not a guide to gaming applicant-tracking systems, and not a general AI manual — it is one search, run honestly, as a way of teaching a discipline that travels.

## What governs this repository: Snickerdoodle

This repository is one *domain* governed by **Snickerdoodle** (`SNICKERDOODLE.md`) — an agent-operating-system that treats a project as a contract between human judgment and AI execution, with named principles, hard gates cleared by a logged human, and a `DRAFT`-to-`VERIFIED` lifecycle. Start with `_MANIFEST.md` (the read-first map); `DOMAIN.md` describes what is runnable today, and `logs/RUN_LOG.md` records what has actually been run.

## INFO 7375 assignment submission (Aakash Belide)

The validation report is [`Belide_Aakash_ReallocationEngine.md`](Belide_Aakash_ReallocationEngine.md). It documents all 7 skeptical checks against a real reallocation tool built on top of this repo's own Ch.11 scorer — reallocating a candidate's finite OPT application effort across companies, using the H-1B/SEC sponsorship data already in this repo.

**Run it from a clean checkout:**
```bash
npm install
node scripts/reallocate/allocate.mjs data/raw/reallocation-audit/candidates.json
```
This prints a real reallocation plan (which companies get an application slot, which are blocked pending a liveness check) and writes `data/raw/reallocation-audit/{roles.json,role-scores.json,role-scores.md,reallocation-plan.json}`. No network calls, no API keys required, no private data used — every company name is public, sourced from `data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped.csv`.

See also: `journal/frictional-journal.md` (Frictional Journal — prediction + reflection), `data/raw/reallocation-audit/gigo-audit.md` (Component 2 audit).

## How this connects to Medhavy

These are Kindle / online editions, designed for integration with **Medhavy** (also **Medhavi**), an AI-powered intelligent-textbook system in which the chapters become adaptive practice — hints, worked examples, quizzes, and feedback loops. Learn more at https://www.medhavy.com/.
